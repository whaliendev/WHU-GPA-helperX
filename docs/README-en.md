## Usage

You can use this extension either through chrome developer mode(add to your chrome manually) or chrome web store.

### TL; DR

Download this extension at chrome web store, then enjoy it.

### chrome developer mode

You may know that in this way you need to have the source code locally first (`git clone` or download from [release page](https://github.com/whaliendev/WHU-GPA-helperX/releases)). Next, feel free to extract the zip file to a proper directory if needed.
After that, go to your chrome extension manage page, open the developer mode and click load unpacked as shown below.

### chrome web store

Just go to [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%E6%AD%A6%E6%B1%89%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E6%88%90%E7%BB%A9%E5%8A%A9%E6%89%8Bx/jopdhihepdphcbmbhkhjppilomdgdiaj) and add this extension to your chrome.
If you get the extension in this way, one thing needed to be mentioned is that the version you can get from chrome web store is behind this page's most of the time due to the new release regulation of chrome.

After installation, this extension will be automatically triggered when you are at [the WHU new EAS](https://jwgl.whu.edu.cn/xtgl/index_initMenu.html).
